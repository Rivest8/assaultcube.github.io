        <h3>Help! How do I?</h3>
        <p>
          If you need some help with anything at all, please first search through the <a href="/docs">official documentation</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you still can't find the answer you need, <a href="https://wiki.cubers.net/action/view/Special:Search">search the wiki</a>, and the
          <a href="https://forum.cubers.net/search.php">forums</a>, and if you
          still can't find the answer, post a thread on the forum explaining your situation. You can use this
          <a href="/search.html">search engine</a> to search the whole lot in one go!
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also try <a href="/irc.html">IRC</a> for a real-time response, but be patient (at least 30 min),
          as people "idle" in IRC. You might get an instant response, or it may take a little bit of time.
          Just hang out and see!
